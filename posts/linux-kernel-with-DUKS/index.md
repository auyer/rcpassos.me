This article was accepted by the IEEE VISSOFT 2025, Visualization Challenge Track.

DUKS an innovative framework that supports multiple visualizations and data analyses previously unsupported for the Linux kernel.
Using the Linux kernel mainline as an example, we demonstrate how DUKS could provide valuable insights for understanding the health of the kernel maintainership model.
By coupling information from the kernel git trees collected from the Software Heritage repository alongside authorship information shared in mailing lists, we envision DUKS as a cornerstone open-access utility to support analyses on the Linux kernel evolution and maintenance.
