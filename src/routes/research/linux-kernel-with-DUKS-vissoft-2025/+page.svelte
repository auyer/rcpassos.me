				DUKS an innovative framework that supports multiple visualizations and data analyses
				previously unsupported for the Linux kernel. Using the Linux kernel mainline as an example,
				we demonstrate how DUKS could provide valuable insights for understanding the health of the
				kernel maintainership model. By coupling information from the kernel git trees collected
				from the Software Heritage repository alongside authorship information shared in mailing
				lists, we envision DUKS as a cornerstone open-access utility to support analyses on the
				Linux kernel evolution and maintenance.
